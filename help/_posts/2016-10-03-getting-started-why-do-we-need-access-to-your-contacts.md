We need access to your contacts because  we offer a feature to control access to your availability based on whether someone is in your contacts and because there are entire portions of our service that depends on you being able to indicate contacts that you want to meet with (for ex our Amazon Echo integration).
                                                               
As for "access to mailboxes" we don't actually access your email or do anything related to your emails.
