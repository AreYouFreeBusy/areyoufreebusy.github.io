### **Linking Calendars**

### Which permissions does FreeBusy need?

FreeBusy requires **read/write access to your calendar** and **read access to your contacts**.

Our vision is to build a virtual scheduling assistant that reduces by 10x the time it takes to coordinate a meeting. To deliver on this promise, FreeBusy needs to have read/write access to your calendar (so it can schedule meetings on your behalf when you want it to) and read access to your contacts (so it understands the degree of separation to the people you need to coordinate with). A great example of this in practice is our integration with Amazon Echo ([watch a quick demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/HobWYI-QYQM?t=4m10s)),  which wouldn't even be possible without read access to contacts because when using voice, that's the only way to check someone's availability.
