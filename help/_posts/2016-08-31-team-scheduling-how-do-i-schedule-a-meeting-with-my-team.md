### How do I schedule a meeting with my team?

Select **Meet** from the top navigation.

<br>
On the [Meet](https://freebusy.io/meet) page, start by adding participants.

> **Meetings with external stakeholders**
> 
> Notice in the above example that one of the participants belongs to a different domain.
> As FreeBusy works across organizational boundaries, you can effortlessly cooridnate meetings with external stakeholders, such as suppliers, partners and vendors.

<br>
With each participant that you add, **FreeBusy** will obtain their availability and show the results on the grid.

> **Note**
> By default, a **30-min** duration for a meeting is assumed and can be changed from the **Meeting Details** section.
> Changing the duration will reload availability.

In the example above, **John the Supplier** and **Tim** are rarely available.
Most of the timeslots are therefore **unavailable**.
You can tell a timeslot is **unavailable** when it's **blank**. It will also say "*unavailable*" on hover.

We're interested in scheduling a quick meeting for Friday morning. There are two **available** timeslots.
You can tell a timeslot is **available** when it shows a tick. Its label will tell you how many participants are available.
At 11 a.m., only *2 out of 3* participants are available. **Everyone is available at 11.30 a.m.**

When you hover over an **available** timeslot, you can explore which participants are unavailable.

Notice that at 11 a.m., **Tim** is not available for a meeting.

Let's go ahead and **click on the 11.30 a.m. time**. It's clearly our best choice.
The selected time will show in the section **Meeting Details** on the left.
Provide title and location for the event, which in this case are **Supplier meeting** and **Conference Room A3**.
