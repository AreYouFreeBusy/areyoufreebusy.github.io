To link your calendar to FreeBusy, just [sign in with that calendar](https://freebusy.io/connect).
It takes less than 45 seconds and there's no new account or password to remember.

<br>
When [signing in](https://freebusy.io/connect), let FreeBusy determine your calendar host.
Provide an email address and click **Figure It Out**.
