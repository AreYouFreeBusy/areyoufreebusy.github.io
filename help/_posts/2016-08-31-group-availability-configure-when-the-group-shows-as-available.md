When you create a group, we set a default sharing window of **Monday - Friday, 8am to 8pm**.
<br>
You can easily change the times at which the group is available.

<br>
To do so, select **Groups** from the top navigation.

In a section titled **Time Range**, check the days you wish to share.
Edit the time of day if necessary and click **Save**.

> **Note**
>
> The **Time Range** options set for a group denote the *maximum* time range shared with the audience.
> If a group member sets a more restrictive time range for their account, their availability will be clipped.
