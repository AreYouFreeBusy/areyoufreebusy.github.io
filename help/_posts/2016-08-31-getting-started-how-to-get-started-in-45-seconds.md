Unlike anything else out there, you don't have to create a new account or start a new calendar. FreeBusy works with any calendar you already have, and is the only solution that shows and co-ordinates your free and busy schedule across all your existing calendars, and with anyone you choose to.

[Sign in with your existing calendar](https://freebusy.io/connect) and avoid the back-and-forth forever.
