 2. In the address bar type `chrome://extensions` and press ENTER
 3. Find the **FreeBusy Scheduling Assistant** extension
 4. Click on **options** *Dont worry that the screen reads coming soon*
 5. Press CTRL and +/- (or scroll wheel) and get the page zoom to 100%
 
 
Now your screen should display the widget look this:
