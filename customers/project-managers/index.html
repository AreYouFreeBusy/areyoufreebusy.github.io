								Below is a testimonial of one of our clients that works as a <b>Product Development Manager</b>, in role which which he's very much engaged with customers on a daily basis as well as managing his Engineering and development team.
                                <br><br>
								Using <b>FreeBusy</b> enabled him to focus more on his engineering team and spend more of his valuable time on the product, leaving the back and forth of scheduling a meeting on us <b>FreeBusy</b>
                                <br><br>
								Ross’s role is very much a client facing role as much as it is a product development manager meaning he has a lot of business to handle in house with his team of engineers as well as meeting with clients and users of the solutions for feedback whether it’s from sales, marketing team or feedback from day to day users.
                                <br><br>
								With scheduling being a streamlined process now Ross has more time for his team to lead and develop them producing great products and innovations.
