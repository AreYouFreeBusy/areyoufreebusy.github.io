Lads, Lasses are you into football? You must be buzzing for Euro 2016 then!!

Here are just a few tips to keep up to date with the games and not miss <!--more--> any of them.

**Never miss a match**

It doesn’t matter whichever team you support whether its England, Germany, France, or Italy we all agree none of us want to miss their favorite team playing.

Always stay up to date with all the action by using this [UEFA app](https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=2313462.html) to keep in touch and enjoy the euro 2016 in France  :) 

**Watching the game with your colleagues**

You’re probably going to be watching the games with your mates & buddies either from work or your friends outside the office. Find an easy way to arrange all meetings you have with them with [FreeBusy](https://freebusy.io/) identifying the location for the meetup and the time of the games and send an invite. All they have to do is accept which games they will be coming to watch and which they cannot make.

FreeBusy makes it easy to pick and know who's coming to what game and who isn’t.

Wether you're using **Gmail**, **Outlook 365** or **Hotmail**.. we've got you covered here below is a small tutorial of how i scheduled watching the semi final's between France and Germany with my mates using gmail.

Simply installed the freebusy [**Gmail plug-in**](https://freebusy.io/chrome) and composed an email to be sent to my mates, the calendar below shows the times that we're all free to meet.

Choosing the time to meet is done by just clicking on the time slots and writing down the location of the meet.

You just have to press that green button on the right that says"_Insert Proposed times into email_" and this is what you should see

All i need now is for my mates to accept the time i proposed and an email confirmation would be sent that a meeting is set, and we can get this game started with a nice cold pint.
