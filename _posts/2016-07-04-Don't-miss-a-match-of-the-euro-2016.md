Lads, Lasses are you into football? You must be buzzing for Euro 2016 then!!!

Here are just a few tips to keep up to date with the games and not miss any of them.

**Never miss a match**

It doesn’t matter whichever team you support whether its England, Germany, France, or Italy we all agree none of us want to miss their favorite team playing.

Always stay up to date with all the action by using this [UEFA app](http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/news/newsid=2313462.html) to keep in touch and enjoy the euro 2016 in France  :) 

**Watching the game with your colleagues**

You’re probably going to be watching the games with your mates & buddies either from work or your friends outside the office. Find an easy way to arrange all the meetings you have with them with [FreeBusy](https://freebusy.io/) identifying the location for the meetup and the time for the games and send an invite all they have to do is accept which games they will be coming to watch and which they cannot make.

FreeBusy makes it easy to pick and know who's coming to what game and who isn’t.

**Where to watch the game**
